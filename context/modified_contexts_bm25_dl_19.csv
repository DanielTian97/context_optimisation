47923,m_8641107,Axons usually have thousands of terminal branches that each end as a bulbous enlargement called a synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. Synaptic knobs contain several membrane-bounded synaptic vesicles that are 40 to 100 nanometers in diameter.,1

When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it’s going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.",2

182539,m_57443,Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.,1

Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (−252.87°C, −423.17 °F).
