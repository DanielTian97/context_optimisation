You now know what patterning a shotgun means, but why do hunters pattern their shotguns in the first place? When you shoot a shotgun while hunting, you want to make sure that you are familiarized with how it works, don't you? This is called “patterning your shotgun.” All shotgun hunters need to pattern their firearms to determine which brands of shells, shot sizes, and loads perform best and at what range.
