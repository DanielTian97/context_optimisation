John Harrison (3 April [O.S. 24 March] 1693 – 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of calculating longitude while at sea. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. Our object is one of those lower-cost chronometers, made in 1800 by Thomas Earnshaw. The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail. Again there were scientists and artists on board, and for the first time chronometers, one of which was Kendall's copy of John Harrison's famous no. 4 marine chronometer. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles. The term chronometer (From Greek: Χρονόμετρο) is a specific type of mechanical timepiece tested and certified to meet certain precision standards. He based his design on Harrison’s clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s. ",0

John Harrison (3 April [O.S. 24 March] 1693 – 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of calculating longitude while at sea. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. Our object is one of those lower-cost chronometers, made in 1800 by Thomas Earnshaw. The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. He based his design on Harrison’s clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s. He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail. Again there were scientists and artists on board, and for the first time chronometers, one of which was Kendall's copy of John Harrison's famous no. 4 marine chronometer. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles. The term chronometer (From Greek: Χρονόμετρο) is a specific type of mechanical timepiece tested and certified to meet certain precision standards. ",0
