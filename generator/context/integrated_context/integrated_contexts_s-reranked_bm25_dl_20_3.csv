730539,i_r_c_730539,"The term chronometer was coined by Jeremy Thacker of Beverley, England in 1714, referring to his invention of a clock ensconced in a vacuum chamber. John Harrison (3 April [O.S. 24 March] 1693 – 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of calculating longitude while at sea. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. Our object is one of those lower-cost chronometers, made in 1800 by Thomas Earnshaw. The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail. Again there were scientists and artists on board, and for the first time chronometers, one of which was Kendall's copy of John Harrison's famous no. 4 marine chronometer. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles. The term chronometer (From Greek: Χρονόμετρο) is a specific type of mechanical timepiece tested and certified to meet certain precision standards. He based his design on Harrison’s clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s. ",0

The epithelium of the terminal bronchioles is composed of three types of cells-ciliated cells, nonciliated cells and a few basal cells.The epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. This type of tissue is found lining parts of the body such as the kidney tubules and walls of respiratory bronchioles.The cells of simple cuboidal epithelium are specialized for diffusion and absorption. The bronchi become smaller the closer they get to the lung tissue and are then considered bronchioles. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the term used to describe the buildup of fibrous, granulation tissue that develop in the bronchiole, which obstructs the air flow. Definition: although often used to refer solely to alveolar tissue, term describes any form of lung tissue including bronchioles, bronchi, blood vessels, interstitium, and alveoli.
